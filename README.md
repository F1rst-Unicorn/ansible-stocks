# Stocks Server

Set up a new stocks server and configure it.

## Setup

All relevant variables are listed in the defaults. The database is only
configured if it is not already present. Otherwise no destructive action is
performed.

### DB Setup

Currently setting up the database is only supported by delegating this to the db
host where a superuser is available who can authenticate via peer
authentication.
